    "## Lesson 3.3: Sets\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Creating and Accessing Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set with the first 10 positive integers. Print the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Adding and Removing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the number 11 to the set created in Assignment 1. Then remove the number 1 from the set. Print the modified set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two sets: one with the first 5 positive integers and another with the first 5 even integers. Perform and print the results of union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations on these sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Set Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new set containing the squares of the first 10 positive integers using a set comprehension. Print the new set.\n",

    "### Assignment 7: Subsets and Supersets\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two sets: one with the first 5 positive integers and another with the first 3 positive integers. Check if the second set is a subset of the first set and if the first set is a superset of the second set. Print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Frozenset\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a frozenset with the first 5 positive integers. Print the frozenset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Set and List Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set with the first 5 positive integers. Convert it to a list, append the number 6, and convert it back to a set. Print the resulting set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Set and Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary with set keys and integer values. Print the dictionary.\n",

    "### Assignment 11: Iterating Over Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set and iterate over the elements, printing each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: Removing Elements from Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set and remove elements from it until it is empty. Print the set after each removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: Set Symmetric Difference Update\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two sets and update the first set with the symmetric difference of the two sets. Print the modified first set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 14: Set Membership Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set and test if certain elements are present in the set. Print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 15: Set of Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a set containing tuples, where each tuple contains two elements. Print the set."
